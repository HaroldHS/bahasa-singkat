# bahasa-singkat
Bahasa Singkat (BaSing) is a small scale and compact programming language for beginners. 
Compiler (JIT compiler) and Interpreter are provided in order to give a better comparison. 

> NOTE: Since the interpreter is written in Haskell, variable assignment/memory allocation is not supported. If you want to use variable / save something in the program, using the compiler is a must.

### Software Requirements
* GHCI
* Golang

### Supported systems
* Linux x86-64

### Installation
No additional installation is needed since the program is intended to be written from scratch (only using the default libraries from GHCI & Golang).
